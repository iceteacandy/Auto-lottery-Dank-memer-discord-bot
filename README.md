# Auto-lottery-Dank-memer-discord-bot 

## Modified a script which was originally written by Cryptos1337 
- Buys a lottery ticket every hour 
- Dont need to host on your own machine
- Adds a few random commands with random cooldowns to make it look legit 
  
## Warning
Before using any of the files, this is a self bot. Read the notes at [my previous macro] (https://github.com/iceteacandy/dank-memer-discord-auto-typer/blob/main/README.md) to stay safe

## Setup
1. Make an account at https://replit.com/ 
2. Make a new Repl and choose python. Give it a name
3. Paste the code of my main.py in your main.py file 
4. Make a new file called keep_alive.py and paste the code from my keep_alive.py . This will make a web server that will be pinged continously through UptimeRobot so the bot doesnt go to sleep
5. Go to the Secrets tab on the left panel and type "TOKEN" into the 'Key' field. Paste your account token(this is user token, not bot token) into the 'Value' field. You can get your token by following the instructions [here] (https://gist.github.com/iceteacandy/eb2a84d4acdce8a5f8b5eb1f674a0c5a) . The 'Secrets' is the only portion of the bot code that other users on Repl won't be able to see. 
6. Run the bot. Copy the link of the web page that pops up. Make an account on UptimeRobot and create a new monitor. Choose https and paste the link in the 'url' tab. Click on 'create monitor'  
7. Change your user status to invisible and go to a private channel and enter "plsstart"
